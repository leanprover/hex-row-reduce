/-!
The `HexRowReduce` library: executable row reduction for the dense
matrices of `HexMatrix`. It re-exports the elementary-operation algebra and
echelon contracts (`RowEchelon`), the pivot search and column elimination
(`Pivot`), the `rowReduce` loop and its correctness (`Loop`), and the row-span
and nullspace APIs (`Span`, `Nullspace`, `Api`), and field inversion and complete
affine solving with inconsistency certificates (`Inverse`, `Solve`).
